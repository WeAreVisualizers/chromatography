Color is widely used in data visualization to show data values. The proper selection of colors is critical to convey information correctly. Usually, the main application for color in data visualization is to encode data. However, the creative use of color is also used either for aesthetic reasons or to highlight certain facets.

It would be great to easily map scalar values to a chosen color. This could be done by either using a continuous function, or, through a discrete mapping. The ordered set of colors that results is commonly called a palette. The proper selection of colors in just the right combination is essential for the optimal display of visual information.
